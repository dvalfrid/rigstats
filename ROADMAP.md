# Roadmap

Planned features in rough priority order. Each item is scoped as a self-contained release.

## v1.6 — NVMe / SSD temperatures

**Panel:** Disk
**Data source:** LHM `Temperatures` section per storage device

LHM already exposes per-drive temperature sensors. The disk panel currently shows
throughput and usage but no thermal data. NVMe drives throttle silently at high
temperatures, making this a high-value, low-effort addition.

**Scope:**

- Parse `Temperatures` nodes per disk device in `lhm.rs`, add `disk_temps: Vec<(String, f64)>` to `LhmData`
- Propagate through `DiskStats` / `StatsPayload`
- Render a °C indicator per drive in `panels/disk.js` with `resolveTempColor` highlighting

## v1.7 — Temperature threshold alerts

**Panel:** Settings (new threshold fields) + tray notifications
**Data source:** Existing CPU / GPU / disk temp fields

The dashboard is currently fully passive. A configurable alert system that fires a
Windows tray notification when a component exceeds its threshold would make the app
genuinely useful during gaming or overclocking sessions.

**Scope:**

- New optional fields in `Settings`: `alert_cpu_temp`, `alert_gpu_temp`, `alert_disk_temp` (all `Option<u8>`)
- Per-tick comparison in `commands.rs`; fire notification via `tauri-plugin-notification` with a cooldown (e.g. 60 s) to avoid spam
- Threshold sliders / inputs in the Settings window

---

## v1.8 — CPU fan speed

**Panel:** CPU
**Data source:** LHM `Fans` section on the CPU device node

GPU fan RPM is already displayed. Adding CPU fan speed is a trivial backend change
(one extra field in `LhmData`) mirrored in the CPU panel.

**Scope:**

- Extract `parent == "Fans"` CPU fan node in `lhm.rs`, add `cpu_fan: Option<f64>` to `LhmData`
- Propagate through `CpuStats`
- Render alongside existing CPU metrics in `panels/cpu.js`

---

## v1.9 — Battery panel (laptop support)

**Panel:** New `battery` panel
**Data source:** `sysinfo` battery API

Relevant for gaming laptops (ASUS ROG, Razer, Alienware). Shows charge %, charge
rate (W), and estimated time remaining. Panel is hidden automatically on systems
with no battery detected.

**Scope:**

- Query `sysinfo::Battery` on startup; store in `AppState` if present
- New `BatteryStats` struct in `stats.rs`, included in `StatsPayload`
- New `panels/battery.js` frontend panel
- Add `battery` to the valid panel keys list in `monitor.rs` and settings

## v2.0 — Auto-update

**Plugin:** `tauri-plugin-updater`
**Distribution:** GitHub Releases (existing pipeline)

Users currently have to manually download and run a new installer for each release.
The Tauri v2 updater plugin checks for a new version on launch, prompts the user,
and installs silently — integrating directly with the existing release-please +
`release.yml` workflow.

**Blocker:** Windows requires a code-signing certificate to avoid SmartScreen warnings
on each update. Worth resolving before implementation starts.

**Scope:**

- Add `tauri-plugin-updater` and configure the update endpoint in `tauri.conf.json`
- Publish a `latest.json` update manifest as a GitHub Release asset in `release.yml`
- Sign the installer in CI using the code-signing certificate
- Add an in-app update check on startup with a user prompt (not silent forced updates)
- Consider Winget publishing as a complementary distribution channel
