# Roadmap

Planned features in rough priority order. Each item is scoped as a self-contained release.

---

## Auto-update ✓

**Plugin:** `tauri-plugin-updater`
**Distribution:** GitHub Releases (existing pipeline)

**Implemented.** On startup the app silently checks for updates after a 10-second
delay, then every 6 hours (handles sleep/wake). If a newer version is available
a badge appears in the dashboard header. Clicking the badge (or "Updates & Changelog"
in the tray menu) opens the updater dialog showing the new version's release notes
from GitHub, the full local version history, and a download progress bar.
After installation the app restarts automatically; the About window opens on the
first launch following an upgrade.

## NVMe / SSD temperatures ✓

**Panel:** Disk
**Data source:** LHM `Temperatures` section per storage device

**Implemented.** Each drive in the disk panel now shows a live temperature reading
in °C, color-coded by `resolveTempColor` (warm at 55 °C, hot at 70 °C).

LHM sensor identification uses the `SensorId` field (`/nvme/`, `/hdd/`, `/ata/`, `/scsi/`
prefixes) rather than sensor names, so motherboard and RAM thermal sensors are never
mixed in with disk readings. Warning Composite and Critical Composite threshold
sensors are excluded; the highest real temperature per device is shown.

Drive-letter-to-model mapping is resolved at startup via a WMI three-table join
(`Win32_DiskDrive → Win32_DiskDriveToDiskPartition → Win32_LogicalDiskToPartition`),
with a PowerShell CIM fallback. Temperatures are matched by model name (case-insensitive
substring match), so inserting a USB drive never shifts temperatures to the wrong
drive.

## Temperature threshold alerts ✓

**Panel:** Settings (new threshold fields) + tray notifications
**Data source:** Existing CPU / GPU / RAM / disk temp fields

**Implemented.** A configurable alert system fires a Windows tray notification when
a component exceeds its threshold, making the app useful during gaming or overclocking.

Eight optional `Option<u8>` fields added to `Settings` (serialised as camelCase JSON):
`warningCpuTemp`, `warningGpuTemp`, `warningRamTemp`, `warningDiskTemp`,
`criticalCpuTemp`, `criticalGpuTemp`, `criticalRamTemp`, `criticalDiskTemp`.

Per-tick comparison runs in `commands.rs` inside `get_stats()` after the
`StatsPayload` is assembled. Warning and Critical are checked independently —
each has its own 60-second cooldown key (e.g. `"cpu_warning"` vs `"cpu_critical"`)
stored in `AppState.last_alert`. Disk alerts fire on the hottest drive's temperature.
Notifications are sent via `tauri-plugin-notification`; errors are silently discarded
so a failed toast never disrupts the stats tick.

The Settings window has a compact "Temp Alerts" card with number inputs for all
eight thresholds. Blank = disabled (maps to `None`). Yellow column headers for
Warning, red for Critical. Window height bumped from 620 → 700 px to accommodate
the new card.

## CPU fan speed — investigated, skipped

**Panel:** CPU

After investigation across real user LHM data: CPU cooler fans are wired to the
motherboard Super I/O chip and appear as generic `Fan #N` channels alongside all
other chassis fans. LHM provides no signal that identifies which channel is the CPU
cooler. A highest-RPM heuristic was considered but rejected as unreliable (pump
heads, high-RPM case fans, and AIO radiator fans all exceed chassis fan RPM on some
builds). CPU cooler fan speed is instead available in the **Motherboard panel**
alongside all other fan channels.

---

## Motherboard panel ✓

**Panel:** New `motherboard` panel
**Data source:** LHM Super I/O chip node (`/lpc/` SensorId prefix) + WMI `Win32_BaseBoard`

**Implemented.** An optional panel showing the sensors exposed by the motherboard's
Super I/O chip (Nuvoton NCT6799D, ITE IT87xx, Winbond W836xx, etc.) alongside the
detected board name. Useful for monitoring system cooling and voltage rails without
opening the BIOS.

The panel is opt-in (off by default) and enabled via Settings → panel toggles.

**What is shown:**

- **Board name** (e.g. "ASUS PRIME B650M-A AX6 II") — detected at startup via WMI
  `Win32_BaseBoard`; manufacturer normalized (ASUSTeK → ASUS, Micro-Star → MSI, etc.)
- **Super I/O chip name** (e.g. "Nuvoton NCT6799D") — the `grandparent` of the first
  `/lpc/` sensor node
- **Fans:** all active channels in RPM, sorted descending; 0-RPM channels hidden
- **Temperatures:** readings ≥ 5 °C (LHM sentinel value filtered); unnamed channels
  displayed as T1–T6, named channels (e.g. "CPU Core") shown as-is
- **Voltages:** named rails only (`Vcore`, `AVCC`, `+3.3V`, `CPU Termination`, etc.);
  generic `Voltage #N` unmapped slots excluded

**Extraction strategy:** `/lpc/` SensorId prefix is chip-agnostic and works across
all Super I/O models without hardcoding chip names or sensor indices. The same
approach is used for disk temperature matching.

## Stream Deck integration

**Crate:** [`elgato-streamdeck`](https://crates.io/crates/elgato-streamdeck) — talks directly to the Stream Deck hardware over USB HID

Lets streamers and content creators display live hardware stats — CPU load, GPU
temp, VRAM, fan RPM — directly on Stream Deck keys. No Elgato software, no
separate plugin, no HTTP server: RIGStats owns the device entirely.

**Architecture:**

The `elgato-streamdeck` crate wraps `hidapi` and communicates directly with the
USB HID interface. RIGStats detects connected Stream Deck devices on startup,
renders metric values as button images, and pushes them to the device on every
stats tick alongside the normal dashboard update.

**Trade-off:** because HID devices can only be held by one process at a time,
the official Elgato Stream Deck software must not be running simultaneously.
Users who rely on Elgato's software for other profiles/macros cannot use both
at once. This should be clearly communicated at setup time.

**Scope:**

- Add `elgato-streamdeck` (+ `hidapi`) to `Cargo.toml`
- Detect connected Stream Deck devices at startup; store handle in `AppState`
- New `streamdeck.rs` module: `render_key(metric, value, unit) → image`,
  `push_stats(device, &StatsPayload, layout)` called from the stats tick
- Per-key layout configured in Settings: pick metric (CPU load/temp/power,
  GPU load/temp/VRAM, RAM used, disk read/write, ping) and colour thresholds
- Brightness and layout persisted in `Settings`
- Stream Deck integration is opt-in (off by default); auto-disabled when no
  device is detected so the crate has zero overhead on systems without one

## Battery panel (laptop support)

**Panel:** New `battery` panel
**Data source:** `sysinfo` battery API

Relevant for gaming laptops (ASUS ROG, Razer, Alienware). Shows charge %, charge
rate (W), and estimated time remaining. Panel is hidden automatically on systems
with no battery detected.

**Scope:**

- Query `sysinfo::Battery` on startup; store in `AppState` if present
- New `BatteryStats` struct in `stats.rs`, included in `StatsPayload`
- New `panels/battery.js` frontend panel
- Add `battery` to the valid panel keys list in `monitor.rs` and settings
